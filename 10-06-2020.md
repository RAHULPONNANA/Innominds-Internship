# OVERFITTING

High Variance, fits the training set very well but fails to generalize new examples.

To overcome overfitting we 

-> Reduce the number of features

   - Manually
   
    -Model Selection Algorithm
    
->Regularization. - keeps all the features, reduces the magnitude t0

# REGULARIZATION

**Cost Function**

-> If lambda is very high, total cost function = lambda()
   - A straight horizontal line is formed.
