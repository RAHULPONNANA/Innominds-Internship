<h1>Computer Vision</h1>

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.”

<h1>Cats vs Dogs (image recognition)</h2>
<ul>
<li>This simple model is built to clasify or differentiate the cats and dogs images.</li>
<li>A large dataset is taken from kaggle and the data is categorized into dogs and cats.</li>
<li>Preprocessing of images such as resolutions and width are optimized.</li>
<li>80% of the known data is trained as a model.</li>
<li>The remaining 20% of the data is tested and the entropy or the error is calculated.</li>
<li>A plot for the traing and testing data is plotted.</li>
<li>A similar model with more acuracy is built.</li>
<li>The model can now predict the solutions for unknown data with optimized accuracy.</li>
</ul>
