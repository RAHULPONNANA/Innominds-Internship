# Precision and Recall

### F-Score

f-score = ( 2 * precision * recall )/( precision + recall )

among a set of algorithms, to find the best algorithm, we select using f-score.

## High accuracy learning system

Algorithms:

- perceptron (logistic regression)

- winnow

- memory-based

- Naive Bayes

Not the best Algorithm that wins, but who has the most Data.
