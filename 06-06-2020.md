# Machine Learning

According to Arthur Samwell, Field of Study that gives ccomputers the ability to learn without being programmed explicitly.

According to Tom Mitchell,A computer program is said to learn from an experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if performance on T,as measured by P, improves with experience E.






<b>Two types</b>
  <ol>
  <li>Supervised Learning</li>
  <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
  </ol>



<b>Supervised Learning</b>
<ul>
  <li>only the known facts,with labels are plotted</li>
  <li>regression - to predict continuous valued output  eg.house cost</li>
  <li>classification - to predict discrete valued output eg.tumor is malign/benign</li>
  <li>for infinite no. of features SVM(Support Vector Machines) is used</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  
  <b>Unsupervised Learning</b>
<ul>
  <li>Unknown data is plotted</li>
  <li>breaks the unlabelled data into clusters</li>
  <li>organize computing clusters - data centers</li>
  <li>social network analysis - online friends</li>
  <li>market segmentation</li>
  <li>astronomical data analysis</li>
  </ul>
